# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Add functionality to our existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:
  * Enter deposits offline
  * Enter expenses offline
When brought back online:
  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.




* Deploy your application with [Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.](../04-Important/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)
